       "\"New York City (NYC), often called simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy.Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were created when local governments were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.\""

      "AAH is a pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United Kingdom. Originally formed in 1892 as a company selling solid fuels in South Wales, it was floated on the stock exchange in 1923. It diversified into pharmaceuticals in the 1970s, and since 1995 it has been a subsidiary of the German company Celesio AG.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== History ==\n",
      "AAH originated in 1892, when Cleeves Company was formed in Wales, owning about 7,000 acres of land. It merged with two local companies, Gurnos and Gellveeidrim, to form Amalgamated Anthracite Collieries Limited.\n",
      "The Chairman of the company was Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett, and it was floated on the Stock Exchange on 29 June 1923, having been registered as a public company on 16 June 1923.  The registered office was 29/30 King Street, Cheapside, London. Amalgamated Anthracite Collieries Limited held its first company meeting on 5 September 1923 at the Cannon Street Hotel.\n",
      "From mid-1925 to at least the end of 1926, all coal mining activities in the England had ceased, resulting in major financial problems for the industry.  This was a driving force behind the eventual merger with United Anthracite Collieries Limited.  On 1 July 1927, the company merged with United to become known as A.A.C Anthracite, based at 120 Fenchurch Street.\n",
      "AAH's original business was producing and distributing anthracite and other solid fuels across South Wales. The company later diversified its interests in different markets including health services, building materials, transport, warehousing and environmental services (landscape conservation and waste disposal). In 1954, it was agreed to change the company name to Amalgamated Anthracite Holdings Limited (AAH). In early 1971 the company abbreviated its name to AAH Limited.\n",
      "In 1976, AAH sold off its interests in fuel and building materials. Healthcare services became the company's main business activity. AAH expanded its pharmaceutical interest by taking over a large number of businesses including Chemists Holding and Hills Pharmaceuticals.\n",
      "AAH Limited became a constituent company of AAH Holdings in 1981, based in London. In 1985 the headquarters of AAH Holdings plc moved to the south of Lincoln. By the late 1980s, when based in Lincoln, the holding company was turning over GB£1 billion, though the turnover for the pharmaceutical section was only in the range of GB£20 million.In 1985 AAH acquired pharmaceutical wholesaler Vestric Limited from Glaxo P.L.C., which continued the company's growth and led to the formation of AAH Pharmaceuticals Limited.\n",
      "In 1991, AAH arranged to distribute drugs marketed by ICI to hospitals in Britain, while ICI retained distribution logistics to pharmacies in the country.By 1994, the company's headquarters had relocated to Runcorn in Cheshire, where it employed 3200 people.  The company was bought by Celesio AG in 1995 (formerly GEHE AG,). In 1999 the headquarters moved to Coventry, where it remains as of 2012.\n",
      "In 2003, the company was among several which were accused by the MHRA of \"breaches of trust\" involving the offering \"benefits to pharmacists in return for buying medicinal products from certain suppliers;\"  AAH, and the other firms, terminated the offending schemes following the accusations.In 2005, the company implemented supply chain and customer relationship management software provided by Cyclone Commerce.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Branches ==\n",
      "The AAH group has several branches. The Enterprise branch sells health and beauty products to over 5000 independent pharmacies in the UK. The Trident branch is a shortline supplier to independent pharmacies in the UK. Wilkinson Healthcare provides independent pharmacies with surgical services. Dextrous provides logistical services to manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",

      "== Operations ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The head office is situated off the A4600 (former A46) south of junction 2 (M69) of the M6 in the north of Coventry on the Coventry Walsgrave Triangle.\n",
      "It has 19 depots around the UK including locations in Belfast, Glasgow, and Sussex.AAH is among those companies that worked for many years without a management-endorsed mission statement.  By the 2000s, management had composed and published a mission statement that began \"We are the UK's leading distributor or pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services to pharmacies, hospitals, and doctors.\"\n",

The company was subsequently established as Allergologisk Laboratorium København. The company has since focused on mapping the mechanisms of allergic impact on the immune system in order to develop new and improved allergy therapies. The research focuses on prevention, treatment, and management of allergies, especially hay fever and asthma. In 1925 Juan Abello Pascual founded Abello Pharmaceuticals in Spain. \n",
      "In 1978, ALK released the first standardized line of products for the treatment of allergies. In 1992 ALK and Abello merged. In the 1990s, ALK was the first company to launch sublingual immunotherapy drops (allergy immunotherapy administered as droplets under the tongue). In recent years, ALK’s research and development strategy has been focused on introducing a range of sublingual immunotherapy tablets (SLIT-tablets).

      "\n",
      "== History ==\n",
      "On October 19, 2011, Abbott Laboratories announced its plan to separate into two publicly traded companies. The new Abbott Laboratories would specialize in diversified products including medical devices, diagnostic equipment and nutrition products, while AbbVie would operate as a research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer. The separation was effective January 1, 2013, and AbbVie was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ABBV) on January 2, 2013.According to Miles White, CEO at the time, the purpose of the split was to allow markets to value the two businesses separately. Some investors were concerned that the split was done to protect the value of the device business from the loss of value facing the drug division due to the imminent expiration of patents on Humira, which accounted for about half of the drug division's revenue.As of December 2015, the company employed in excess of 28,000 globally, and provided products to individuals in more than 170 countries.In March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic developed into an international crisis, the Israeli government announced that it would force AbbVie to license its patents for Kaletra, the brand name of lopinavir/ritonavir, a fixed dose combination medication for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS which was also thought to have some applicability to fighting COVID-19. In response, AbbVie announced that it would cease enforcing its patents on the drug entirely.\n",

      "== Acquisitions ==\n",
      "In January 2014, the company acquired ImmuVen for an undisclosed sum. On September 3, 2014, AbbVie and Infinity Pharmaceuticals announced that they had entered into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize duvelisib, Infinity's PI3K inhibitor for the treatment of patients with cancer. On the same day, AbbVie and Calico announced that they had entered into a R&D collaboration intended to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer. California Life Company, operating as Calico, is an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary focused on aging and age-related diseases, and led by former Genentech chairman and CEO of Arthur D. Levinson and former Genentech EVP and chief medical officer Hal V. Barron.In October 2014, after a long negotiation, AbbVie stopped its efforts to acquire Shire, which would have been one of the largest M&A deals of that year and one of the largest tax inversions in history, due to changes in the US tax code by the US Treasury; AbbVie had to pay a $1.6 billion breakup fee.On March 4, 2015, AbbVie announced its agreement to acquire the oncology firm Pharmacyclics and its treatment for blood cancers, ibrutinib; AstraZeneca had also been bidding to acquire Pharmacyclics. Under the terms of the transaction, AbbVie agreed to pay $261.25 per share as a mix of cash and AbbVie equity. The acquisition valued at approximately $21 billion was completed on May 26, 2015. The Pharmacyclics name was retained, and it operates as a subsidiary of AbbVie from its previous Sunnyvale, California, headquarters. On June 3, 2015, AbbVie and Halozyme Therapeutics announced that they had entered into a global collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and commercialize products that combine AbbVie’s treatments and Halozyme’s ENHANZE drug-delivery technology, this was terminated in November 2016.On 28 April 2016, the company announced it would acquire Stemcentrx for up to $9.8 billion. A day later, the company announced an expansion of a two and a half-year-old cystic fibrosis deal with Galapagos, potentially doubling milestone payments to $600 million.On 25 June 2019, AbbVie announced it would acquire Irish-based Allergan plc for about $63 billion; however the transaction would not be structured as a tax inversion, and that post the transaction, AbbVie (and the group) would remain legally domiciled in the U.S. for tax purposes; AbbVie acquisition of Allergan plc violated anti-trust ruled by the Federal Trade Commission on September 4, 2020. In July, the company announced it would acquire Mavupharma, boosting its cancer drug pipeline.\n",

Synlogic is a synthetic biology company built on research from the labs of James Collins and Tim Lu at MIT. As part of the collaboration, AbbVie is getting worldwide rights to Synlogic’s probiotic-based technology for treating inflammatory bowel disease, and the research teams will focus on Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. In April 2016, the company partnered with the University of Chicago to investigate a number of areas of oncology: breast, lung, prostate, colorectal and hematological cancers. In the same month the company announced it would co-commercialize Argenx's preclinical immunotherapy, ARGX-115. ARGX-115 is a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant), a membrane protein believed to enhance the immunosuppressive effects of T cells. The company also announced a deal to co-develop/commercialize at least one of CytomX Probody's conjugates against CD71 (transferrin receptor 1).In March 2020, AbbVie announced plans to evaluate the Kaletra/Aluvia HIV medicine as possible COVID-19 treatment. The company entered into various partnerships with health authorities in different countries to investigate the efficacy of the medication. However, the first non-blinded, randomized trial found the drug not useful to treat severe COVID-19.\n",

AbbVie estimates global sales of the drug at $1 billion in 2016 and $5 billion in 2020.In 2018, it started litigation against NHS England in the Technology and Construction Court claiming that they breached procurement rules and had not treated the company fairly during what was described as \"the single largest medicines procurement ever done by the NHS\" when seeking suppliers for hepatitis C treatments. In 2019, a UK court dismissed AbbVie's case against the NHS.As of 2019, the company remained committed to product development in the cystic fibrosis disease area, despite major success by their main competitor in the area, Vertex.\n",

      "In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company in Ravenswood, Chicago. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (e.g., morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny \"dosimetric granules\". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients. In 1922, the company moved from Ravenswood to North Chicago, Illinois.\n",

      "=== International expansion ===\n",
      "Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently, two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products. Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it merged with Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott, and Richard Ross gained a seat on Abbott's board of directors until his retirement in 1983. The acquisition of Ross brought Similac under the Abbott umbrella. In the years following the acquisition, Pedialyte and Ensure were introduced as nutritional products by Ross Laboratories while under Abbott's leadership.In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, \"In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer\".Today, Abbott operates in over 160 countries.\n",

In 2004, the company acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant.In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash. At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of \"good\", or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.\n",
      "In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on 11 July 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.On 8 September 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer.In November 2007, Abbott announced that Ross Products would be renamed Abbott Nutrition.On 26 February 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. Abbott sold this business to Johnson & Johnson in February 2017. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A.. This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanded its presence in key emerging markets.On 22 March 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS.

Abbott Nutrition, whose products include Similac, Pedialyte, Glucerna, and Ensure, also retained the Abbott name. The company announced that the spun-off research-based pharmaceuticals company would be named AbbVie in March 2012. In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring. The separation was effective as of 1 January 2013.

Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.In September 2015, the company announced it had completed its acquisition of Tendyne Holdings, Inc., a private medical device company focused on developing minimally invasive mitral valve replacement therapies. Tendyne was acquired for a total transaction value of $250 million. In January 2020, the Tendyne Mitral Valve became the world's first commercially available solution for Mitral Valve Replacement Technology. Abbott obtained CE Mark for the device which now makes it possible to implant it in Europe outside of a clinical setting. The US clinical study for federal approval is still ongoing.In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion. In January 2017, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85). On 3 October 2017, the company closed the Alere acquisition making the surviving entity the market leader player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space within the broader $50 billion in-vitro diagnostics market with this takeover. With the acquisition of Alere, the company also obtained the subsidiary Arriva Medical, which is the largest mail-order diabetic supplier. Arriva Medical announced business closure after Abbott acquisition effective 31 December 2017.In 2017, the FDA approved Abbott's FreeStyle Libre glucose monitoring system.

      "Nuplazid, a drug developed by Acadia in the late 1990s, \"was designed to stimulate a subset of the brain’s serotonin receptors, or the proteins that govern memory, cognition and learning.\" On April 29, 2016, the FDA approved Acadia's drug, Nuplazid, for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. Nuplazid is the trade name for Acadia's proprietary molecule, pimavanserin, a selective serotonin inverse agonist preferentially targeting 5-HT2a receptors. Acadia had partnered with Biovail in the late-stage clinical testing of the drug, which showed trial failures as of 2009.Acadia is running multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials with pimavanserin in several central nervous system conditions: dementia-related psychosis, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia inadequate response, and schizophrenia negative symptoms.As of 1997, Acadia was among several companies that licensed compounds from Genzyme's small-molecule compound library.\n",

      "== History ==\n",
      "Acadia started in 1993 as Receptor Technologies, based in Winooski, Vermont.  In 1997, the company relocated all operations and management from Vermont to San Diego, California as a strategic move to garner partnerships with other biotechnology companies.  However, the company also had an office in Denmark, in which it received a crucial part of its early investments from BankInvest, under managing director Florian Schönharting, Kommunernes Pensionsforsikring A/S and Dansk Kapitalanlæg Aktieselskab as well as private investor Lars Christiansen. At the time, the company had fifty employees, fourteen of whom were in the Denmark office.  The focus of the company in its early years was on genetic screens for receptors, aiming to accelerate early stage drug discovery.The company planned to conduct an Initial public offering (IPO) consisting of 31.6% of the company in 2001, with the intention of raising US$64 million and listing on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol ACAD. At the time, Acadia and Allergan were collaborating on development of a treatment for glaucoma, and Allergan would retain a 6.3% ownership stake in Acadia after the IPO.  However, the company's IPO, which ultimately took place in May 2004, did not fare as well as expected and netted only US$35 million.  At the time, the company had five drugs in development and was running two in human trials.  The company had a subsequent round of stock offering in May 2007 which raised US$102 million.In September 2020, Acadia Pharmaceuticals acquired clinical-stage biotechnology company CerSci Therapeutics.\n",

      "Acorda Therapeutics was incorporated in 1995, founded by internist turned entrepreneur Ron Cohen in Hawthorne, New York.  Cohen had previously worked at the tissue engineering firm Advanced Tissue Sciences from 1986 to 1992.  Cohen's focus on neurology at Acorda was influenced by his father's being a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center.  The business model of the company from the start was to work on commercialization of academic discoveries.  A single therapeutic area focus also has the advantage that physicians prescribing one drug might also prescribe another in Acorda's portfolio; for instance, the company planned to leverage physician access through tizanidine capsule sales to promote dalfampridine sales.An initial public offering (IPO) in 2006 raised US$31.5 million, about half of what was expected going into the offering, which was attributed to general weakness of the IPO market at the time.  These funds were supplemented by a private sale of shares later the same year, raising and additional US$29.8 million.As of 2007, twelve years after incorporation, the company had not yet turned a profit.\n",

In November 2016, the company announced it was discontinuing development of the drug for post-stroke walking difficulties, after a clinical trial failure.  In the third quarter of 2019, the company's shares dropped by a significant 65.1% as a result of dalfampridine's multiple sclerosis indication facing competition in the United States.\n",
