       "'This listing is limited to those independent companies and subsidiaries notable enough to have their own articles in Wikipedia.  Both going concerns and defunct firms are included, as well as firms that were part of the pharmaceutical industry at some time in their existence.  Included here are companies engaged not only in pharmaceutical development, but also supply chain management and device development, including compounding pharmacies.  Retail pharmacies; firms specialized in the collection, fractionation and distribution of human blood; and medical device manufacturers where the device is not related to pharmaceutical administration are not included.  Entry titles have been shortened in a number of cases, so that if the article title of a company is \"XYZ Pharma\", for instance, the entry will appear here as \"XYZ\".\\nCompanies which existed as a joint venture for their entire existence are indicated by a super-script \"JV\", as in PerseidJV.\\n\\n\\n== Alphabetical listing—Active firms ==\\n\\n\\n=== #—A ===\\n\\n\\n=== B—D ===\\n\\n\\n=== E—L ===\\n\\n\\n=== M—P ===\\n\\n\\n=== R—T ===\\n\\n\\n=== U—Z ===\\n\\n\\n== Alphabetical listing—Defunct firms ==\\n\\n\\n=== #—A ===\\n\\n\\n=== B—D ===\\n\\n\\n=== E—L ===\\n\\n\\n=== M—P ===\\n\\n\\n=== R—T ===\\n\\n\\n=== U—Z ===\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of largest biotechnology & pharmaceutical companies\\nList of pharmaceutical manufacturers in the UK'"
